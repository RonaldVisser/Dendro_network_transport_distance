# Dendrochronological provenance networks and spatial distance of locations

This repository consists of code and data to create dendrochronological provenance networks and visualise the spatial distance between locations in the network. It uses data from:
Visser, RM. 2021 Dendrochronological Provenance Patterns. Network Analysis of Tree-Ring Material Reveals Spatial and Economic Relations of Roman Timber in the Continental North-Western Provinces. Journal of Computer Applications in Archaeology 4(1): 230â€“253. DOI: https://doi.org/10.5334/jcaa.79.
The data which can be found at: Visser, RM. 2022 Dendrochronological Provenance Patterns. Code and Data of Network Analysis of Tree-Ring Material. DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7157744 = https://github.com/RonaldVisser/ProvenanceNetworks/

The code is used in a submitted paper for the Proceedings of the Limes Congress in 2022:
Ronald M. Visser. Securing transport of wood on water on the Roman Rhine.
